I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at University of California, Merced supervised by [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/). Before coming UC Merced, I received my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from Tsinghua University (THU) and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) on 2016 and 2013 respectively. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndjbuysGBJMMTpmIK3hTD_HfXZVsJzaH/view?usp=sharing).

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.
