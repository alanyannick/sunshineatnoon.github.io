I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at University of California, Merced supervised by [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/). Before coming UC Merced, I received my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from Tsinghua University (THU) and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) on 2016 and 2013 respectively. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndjbuysGBJMMTpmIK3hTD_HfXZVsJzaH/view?usp=sharing).

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
